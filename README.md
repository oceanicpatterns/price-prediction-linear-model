**Project Overview:**

This repository contains the Python code for generating a sample dataset (simulating Snowflake interaction) and building a simple linear regression model to predict closing prices based on volatility index.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.7 or later (strongly recommended, as 3.6 is nearing end-of-life)
- VSCode
- Familiarity with Snowflake concepts (understanding of tables, columns, and data manipulation)

**Setting Up the Environment:**

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    - Open VSCode and open the integrated terminal.
    - Run the command `python -m venv SnowflakePyConnectorEnv`.
    - Activate the virtual environment by running `. SnowflakePyConnectorEnv/bin/activate`.

2. **Install Required Packages:**
    - Activate the virtual environment (if not already).
    - Run the command `pip install pandas scikit-learn pytest fakesnow`.

**Running the Script and Understanding the Code:**

1. **Execution:**
    - In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing `ml_model.py`.
    - Run the script using `python ml_model.py`.

2. **Code Structure:**
    - **`ml_model.py`:** This script simulates data interaction with Snowflake, generates a sample dataset, builds the model, evaluates its performance, and generates a report. It primarily uses pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and `fakesnow` to mock Snowflake connections during testing (important for reliability and isolation).

**Running Tests:**

1. **Install pytest:**
    - Make sure you have `pytest` installed (`pip install pytest`).
2. **Test Execution:**
    - In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing `test_ml_model.py`.
    - Run the command `pytest test_ml_model.py`.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Focus on Sample Data and Local Execution:** This example emphasizes using sample data and mocking Snowflake connections for testing purposes. This approach improves code robustness and avoids external dependencies.
- **Best Practices:** While Snowflake interaction isn't directly implemented here, consider incorporating security best practices like using secure credential management or environment variables if you need to connect to a real Snowflake instance.
- **Customization and Improvement:** Feel free to modify this code as needed to suit your specific data and model requirements.
